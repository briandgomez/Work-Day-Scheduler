# Description
A work day scheduler allows people to keep track and organize their tasks easily.The one created in this repository allows people to keep track of their tasks on a hourly basis ranging from 8am-5pm. The user can create a new task and save it using the 'save' button located on the right side of each time block. The colors indicate how close they are until their deadline. For example grey represents the deadline has passed, red represents the deadline is now, and green represents the deadline is in the future.
